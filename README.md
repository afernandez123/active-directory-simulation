# Active Directory User Management Simulation

## Objective
Demonstrate fundamental Active Directory (AD) user management operations commonly performed by Helpdesk and IT Support technicians, simulated using Linux terminal commands.

## Tasks Completed
- Created a new user account (John Doe)
- Reset the user's password
- Disabled the user account
- Added the user to a security group (Developers)

## Simulated Environment
Performed in Rocky Linux using standard user management commands to mirror Active Directory operations.

## Screenshots
- User account creation and password setup
- User account disablement (lock)
- Adding user to a security group

## Purpose
While this simulation uses Linux, the fundamental concepts of account creation, management, and group assignment directly mirror standard Windows Active Directory workflows used by IT professionals.
